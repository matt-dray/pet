A persistent cyberpet that lives on the command line. 

A proof-of-concept to learn more about packaging-up command-line interfaces (CLIs) made with Python and tools like [InquirerPy](https://inquirerpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [platformdirs](https://platformdirs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
